# Rick and Morty test

## Implementation
Completed as part of the Metabolic front-end developer internships interview process. To completed this project, I installed Bulma framework to make use of some components and features as well as sass. Plan on continuing to play around the API and add more features, ie: multiple search fields, highlight specific selection, adapt all character card links (which currently link to homepage).

## Introduction

Welcome to the Metabolic front-end developer internship test. It should take you between 2 and 6 hours depending on your experience.

The primary goal of this exercise is to assess how you reason about your ability to write well defined HTML, CSS and JavaScript using the latest patterns and technologies. There's no hard rules or tricky questions.

**We hope you have fun.**

## Brief

We have prepared a skeleton app for you, but please change whatever you want. It currently simply lists the names of characters in [Rick and Morty](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2861424/).

### 1. Character grid

Build out this skeleton to make it look like the character grid on https://rickandmortyapi.com/. This will require retrieving more information from the GraphQL API. Links don't need to work.

### 2. Character status filter

Add a character status filter (alive, dead or unknown). This can be a simple select element.
Feel free to default to alive.
